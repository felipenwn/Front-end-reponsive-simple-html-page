this is my first week studying html and css and consequently this was my first challenge, I decided by trying to not googling so much to test my front end dev level, in short I used a lot of workarounds due to my lack of knowledge, but in the end the The site looks very similar to the original design, which is very impressive.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.


### Built with
